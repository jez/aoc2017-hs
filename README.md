# Advent of Code 2017 (Haskell)

My solutions to the <https://adventofcode/2017>.

## Setup

It's using the Haskell Stack for building, running, and testing:

```shell
# --- after cloning ---

# to get the solutions for my version of the puzzles:
stack build
stack exec aoc2017

# or, to run the unit tests:
stack test
```
